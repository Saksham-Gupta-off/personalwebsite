# Personal Website
<br>

This is my Personal Website. It is a little poor in DRY coding, but was made as an assignment. It contains a lot of work and many hours of googling for tutorials and code for fitting and adding various components. The JS and icon codes in the assets are completely copied from HTML5 UP. The basic design was chosen after looking at various websites, and I thought a simple black and white template should be good. Any recommendations are welcome, and feel free to peruse :)
